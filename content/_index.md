I'm a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> and <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>. My research interests are lossless data compression, information theory, and AI.

Originally, I am from Florianópolis (Brazil) but I've lived in New Jersey, Orlando, Toronto, São Paulo, as well as other smaller cities in the south of Brazil.

Currently interning at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/) for the summer.
