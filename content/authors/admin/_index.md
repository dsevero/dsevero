Looking for an opportunity to make the jump from Industry to Academia. I'm interested in learning more about the intersection between Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Learning for Neural Networks and their applications to Health and Privacy. I'm also interested in how Machine Learning can be seen as an Information Theory problem.

For recruiters: I'm not interested in positions working directly, or indirectly, with e-commerce.
