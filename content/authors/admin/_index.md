<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm a Researcher at <a href="https://research.3778.care/">3778 Healthcare</a> working with Machine Learning for Healthcare. Previously, I was Head of Data Science at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/linx-impulse/">Linx Impulse</a> and a Researcher at the <a href="https://www.certi.org.br/en/">CERTI Foundation</a> where I worked with Signal Processing and Embedded Systems.
<br>
<br>
I'm interested in learning more about the intersection between Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Learning for Neural Networks as well as their applications to Health and Privacy. I'm also interested in how Machine Learning can be seen as an Information Theory problem.
<br>
<br>
Originally, I am from Florianópolis, Brazil but I've lived in New Jersey, Orlando, Toronto and São Paulo as well as other smaller cities in the south of Brazil. I enjoy reading, playing american football and <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/">KSP</a>
