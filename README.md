I'm a graduate student at the University of Toronto studying Machine/Computational/Statistical Learning and Information Theory.

Originally, I am from Florianópolis, Brazil but I've lived in New Jersey, Orlando, Toronto and São Paulo as well as other smaller cities in the south of Brazil. I enjoy reading, playing american football.
