What constitutes as novel is decided through a consensus mechanism together with a similarity function, which is selected according to the content type (e.g. full-motion videos, textual documents). Scalability is guaranteed by forming a validation committee with cryptographic sortition, which use statistical hypothesis testing to decide on the probability of a content being novel or not. The system can trade-off computational with statistical performance by manipulating parameters. We discuss the usage of this design to secure the novelty of full-motion videos and end with a proposal of future lines of research that can extend the systems capabilities.}, publisher={figshare}, author={Severo, Daniel}, year={2019}, month={Nov} }
